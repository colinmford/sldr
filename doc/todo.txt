# TODO

- Where the identity block doesn't align with the filename, sort it out, putting extra info into sil:identity
- Remove redundant empty collations elements
- Can we assume layout/characterOrder is left-to-right?
- If there is a digraph in main, should the sort order also have one?
- Give every file a localeNames/special/sil:name for english
- Fill out autonyms from Ethnologue
- remove all suspect data (if there is something better)
- fixup fontroles, causing ~20 validation failures

# TODO

x Where the identity block doesn't align with the filename, sort it out, putting extra info into sil:identity
- Remove redundant empty collations elements
- Can we assume layout/characterOrder is left-to-right?
- If there is a digraph in main, should the sort order also have one?
x Give every file a localeNames/special/sil:name for english
x Fill out autonyms from Ethnologue
- remove all suspect data (if there is something better)
x fixup fontroles, causing ~20 validation failures
- create a test to ensure all collation elements are in an exemplar.
x fix old fontrole structure

# Issues

- is the sil:identity/@defaultRegion really the defaultRegion?
